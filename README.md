# 🌌 code-cosmos-js

A universe of JavaScript creations — from tiny experiments to full-fledged cosmic builds.

Welcome to **code-cosmos-js**, a personal hub where I (Vaishnavi / VeeBee) explore, practice, and build with everything JavaScript — from fundamentals to futuristic frameworks.

This repo holds my daily projects, experiments, and creative builds across the JS ecosystem.
